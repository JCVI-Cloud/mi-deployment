# This file contains the list of system-level packages and libraries.
# The list is grouped by applications or application suites that require
# the given package. See conf.yaml for top-level, applications' configuration.
# Any package commented out here will not be installed on the target system.
# It is OK to have packages listed in more than one place too - that way it is
# easier to omit which applications not to install without affecting other stuff.
